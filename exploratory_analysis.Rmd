## Importing NHATS data and selecting only relevant variables

Using only round 5 data, included ID variable, the two variables needed for the depression risk scale (PHQ-2), gender, age, race, whether participant uses mobility devices, size of social network, self-rated memory, self-rated health, and whether they are happy with their living situation. 

In creating dichotomous variable phq_cat regarding depression status, phq.total was subtracted by 2 to account for the fact that total scores on the PHQ-2 should range from 0-6 (sum of two items ranging from 0-3, while scores for the two items provided in our data ranged from 1-4). Once 2 was subtracted from the total score, phq_cat was dichotomized based on a cutoff point of 3 or higher.

Categorical variables were recoded to include descriptions of values and converted into factors.

The following variables will be included in analyses:

* `gender`: Gender (Male, Female)
* `age_cat`: Categorical age at interview (65 to 69, 70 to 74, 75 to 79, 80-84, 85-89, 90+)
* `race_ethnicity`: Race and hispanic ethnicity (White, non-hispanic; Black, non-hispanic; Other, non-Hispanic; Hispanic)
* `cane_walker_wheelchair`: Used cane, walker, wheelchair (Yes, No)
* `memory`: Rate your memory (Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, Poor)
* `overall_health`: Overall health condition (Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, Poor)
* `likes_living_situation`: Likes living situation (Agree a lot, Agree a little, Agree not at all)
* `social_network_size`: Social network size (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

The outcome variable of interest is:

* `phq_cat`: Depression (dichotomized based on total PHQ-2 score)

Preliminary exploratory visualizations of the three demographic variables, gender, age, and race/ethnicity, to illustrate the frequencies per category. 

```{r nhats_demo}

gender_bar = 
  nhats  %>%   
  count(gender) %>% 
  mutate(gender = fct_reorder(gender, n)) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~gender, y = ~n, color = ~gender, type = "bar", colors = "viridis")

Plotting of participant view of living situation predictor against PHQ-2, stratified by race (EM) to show the differences in PHQ-2 (depression risk scale) distribution across categories. 

```{r nhats_living_situation}

living_plot = nhats %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = likes_living_situation, y = phq.total, color = race_ethnicity)) + 
  geom_point(position = "jitter", size = 0.5) + 
  labs(title = "View of living situation and PHQ-2 score distribution",
       x = "Likes living situation", y = "PHQ-2 score") + 
  facet_grid(rows = vars(race_ethnicity)) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")

ggplotly(living_plot)

```

Plotting social network (by race/gender/age_cat) and health by phq_cat:

```{r}
sn_phq = nhats %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = social_network_size, group = phq_cat)) + 
    geom_bar(aes(y = ..prop.., fill = factor(..x..)), stat = "count") +
    geom_text(aes( label = scales::percent(round(..prop.., 3)),
                   y = ..prop.. ), stat = "count", vjust = -.3, size = 2.5) +
    labs(y = "Percent", fill = "SN") +
    facet_grid(~phq_cat) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)

ggplotly(sn_phq)

health_phq = nhats %>% 
  filter(hc5health > 0) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = overall_health, group = phq_cat)) + 
    geom_bar(aes(y = ..prop.., fill = factor(..x..)), stat = "count") +
    geom_text(aes( label = scales::percent(round(..prop.., 2)),
                   y = ..prop.. ), stat = "count", vjust = -2, size = 3) +
    labs(y = "Percent", fill = "Overall Health") +

####  Visualizing any differences in depression outcome by predictor, self-rated memory. 

- Survey respondents were asked to rate their memory on a scale of 1-5, 1 being Excellent and 5 being Poor. This plot is a visualiztion of the proportion of respondents in this dataset by their depression outcome status - Mild/No Depression or Moderate/Severe Depression. The figure is broken down by how participants rated their memory (x-axis). 

```{r}
mem_plot = nhats %>%  group_by(phq_cat, memory) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% mutate(
  proportion = (n / sum(n)))

  memory_plot = mem_plot %>% mutate(memory = factor(memory)) %>% drop_na() %>%   
    ggplot(aes(x = memory, y = proportion, group = phq_cat)) + geom_line(alpha = 0.4) +
  
    geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = "red") + 
    facet_grid(~phq_cat) + 
    labs( title = "Self rated memory and depression outcomes",
    x = "Self rated memory", y = " Proportion of respondents") +  
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)
  
ggplotly(memory_plot)
```


####  Visualizing any differences in depression outcome by predictor, use of cane walker wheelchair. 

- Survey respondents were asked if they used a cane walker wheelchair. This plot is a visualization of the proportion of respondents in this dataset by their depression outcome status - Mild/No Depression or Moderate/Severe Depression. The figure is broken down by if participants responded Yes, or No (x-axis). 
```{r}
cane_walker_wc_plot = nhats %>%  
    group_by(phq_cat, cane_walker_wheelchair) %>% 
    summarise(n = n()) %>%  
    mutate(proportion = (n / sum(n)))

cane_walker_wc_plot = 
  cane_walker_wc_plot %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x = cane_walker_wheelchair, y =proportion)) + 
  geom_col(fill= "light blue") + facet_grid(~phq_cat)+
  labs( title = "Use of cane walker wheelchair and depression outcomes",
      x = "Asked if used a cane walker wheel chair", y = " Proportion of respondents")+  
    scale_x_discrete(
      labels = c("Yes","No")) + 
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)

  ggplotly(cane_walker_wc_plot)
```


### Multivariable Logistic Regression Model:

```{r}
logit_model = nhats %>%
  mutate(phq_cat = if_else(phq_cat == "Mild/No Depression", 0, 1)) %>%
  glm(phq_cat ~ gender + age_cat + race_ethnicity + cane_walker_wheelchair + memory + overall_health + likes_living_situation + social_network_size, family = "binomial", data = .) 

logit_model %>%
  broom::tidy() %>%
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate)) %>%
  select(term, betas = estimate, OR, p.value) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)

```
