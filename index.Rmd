### Introduction:

Previous literature has examined a wide range of risk factors for depression in
older adults. Older age, female gender, isolation, and physical health
have all be found to be risk factors for depression in older adults
(Sözeri-Varma). Memory issues and disorders affecting cognition are also
associated with depression risk (Köhler et al, 2010). Depression risk in
older adults is also associated with race and ethnicity, with evidence
certain groups have a higher risk of depression (Hooker et al, 2019).
The outcome will be the PHQ-2, which sums two variables rating mood and
well-being on a Likert scale (validated by Kroenke et al, 2003).
